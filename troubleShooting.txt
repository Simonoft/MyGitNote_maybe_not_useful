You can inspect what was checked out with 'git status'
and retry with 'git restore --source=HEAD :/'

Happened when the path is too long?
try the following command:
	git config core.protectNTFS false

------
Try 2:
first do garbage collection:
	git gc
then reset:
	git reset
	git reset --hard HEAD

result:	
	same error massage, unable to stat just-written files.

Try 3:
Clean all files what I last time downloaded.
Do the following command first:
